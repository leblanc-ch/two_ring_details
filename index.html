		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>When we think of blindness, we might think of someone completely lacking sight, but
this is referred to as “total blindness”, and it only affects 15% of those with eye disorders
<a href="https://www.afb.org/blindness-and-low-vision/eye-conditions/low-vision-and-legal-blindness-terms-and-descriptions
" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="citation">[1]</a>. This
leaves 85% with some remaining sight, and for that reason, many low vision people rely on some
sort of text-to-speech software when using a computer, which gives them an audio description of the text on websites. <br><br>
The problem is that not all things on a website are text-based, images, for
example. For that, we have “alt-text”, a brief text description of the image, which can be read by
a screen reader, and that gives the image’s basic context to the page.</p>

		<h2>Problem</h2>
		<p>With that said, not all webpages are accessibility-friendly. In a 2024 study of the top
million webpages, it was found that 54.5% of the pages were missing alt-text on their images,
which makes it the second most prevalent web accessibility failure <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="citation">[2]</a>.

</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>So to combat this, what I propose is Two Ring, an AI audio assistant for those with low vision,
which works like the snip tool, if the snip tool gave a verbal description of the image it was
taking.<p/>

<h2>Interface</h2>
<img src="flowchart_diagram.png" alt="Two Ring Usage Flowchart" class="project-image"></img>
<p>I designed a simple interface, for the purpose of being easy to use. It consists of two buttons:
'Capture' and 'Stop'. Clicking the 'Capture' button allows the user to click and drag to capture an
image, and a text description is created from that image using a machine learning model. Next,
the text description is sent to a text-to-speech software, which reads out the audio description of
the image. From there, the user can capture another image, or they can click ‘Stop’ which exits
the program.
